# How to use the releases?

- Add the local folder as an update site to your eclipse.
	- Open Eclipse --> Help --> Install New Software -- Add... --> Local...

# Setup system before development
    '''
    $ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64
    $ apt-get install maven

- Eclipse Plugins to install
    - Using Help --> Install New Software ... --> Work with: Neon - http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon (from dropdown)
    	- in "type filter text" box search for : m2e â€“ Extensions Development Support
    - Using Help --> Eclipse Marketplace ...
    	- Eclipse Xtext 2.11.0 and Eclipse Xtend 2.11.0

# To start with the development
- Clone the git repository
- Run the mvn build once inside edu.vanderbilt.riaps.system.parent project directory. This step is necessary to create the src-gen and xtend-gen folders. These folders are not tracked in the git repository because they are generated.

    ```
    $ pushd edu.vanderbilt.riaps.system.parent && mvn clean install && popd
    ```

- Then import the workspace into eclipse.
	- File --> Import --> General --> Projects from Folder or Archive --> Directory
	- browse to project git repository
	- **Ensure that you select the option for searching for nested projects.**

    1. edu.vanderbilt.riaps.app
	- Expand the project selection to
	edu.vanderbilt.riaps.app->src->edu.vanderbilt.riaps->GenerateApp.mwe2

    2. edu.vanderbilt.riaps.system
	- Expand the project selection to
	edu.vanderbilt.riaps.system->src->edu.vanderbilt.riaps->GenerateSystem.mwe2
	- Then right click on the mwe2 file and select "Run As --> MWE2 Workflow"
